Description: This package implements a method that takes advantage of a low-dimensional latent linear structure of dependence to improve the stability of correlation estimations. An EM algorithm is used to fit a sparse factor model for correlations. Two functions are available in this package in order to introduce sparsity in the network estimation: one function called emfas.ccdlasso is based on a LASSO estimation using a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm and another one called SparseEmfaBio is based on biological knowledge integration as Gene Ontology annotation.
